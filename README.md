#Project Overview
This project utilizes data analysis and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to identify shopping trends and customer behavior patterns. Using Python, we perform various types of analyses such as trend analysis, customer segmentation, sales forecasting, market basket analysis, and sentiment analysis. These insights help businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve inventory management, and predict future shopping trends.
##Key Features
Trend Identification: Discover key shopping trends such as seasonal variations, product demand, and evolving customer preferences.
Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on purchasing behavior using machine learning techniques.
Sales Forecasting: Predict future sales trends and product demand using AI models.
Market Basket Analysis: Identify associations between products to suggest cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer feedback and reviews to gauge sentiment and improve customer satisfaction.
###Technologies Used
